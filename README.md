# R-tricks

After encountering various situations while doing projects in R, and solving them, I thought - I should keep this script to use it as a reference net time I encounter a similar problem. This repository is for this purpose - except itstead of (or in addition to) keeping full scripts, I will have a single document with just these interesting scripts parts.
